# pubcli

pubcli is a helper tool to do simple task with Google Cloud Pubsub Message.

# Why?

By the time this tool was created, Pubsub emulator [https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator#using_the_emulator] didn't support using `gcloud pubsub` command 

# Installation
```
go install
pubcli -h
```
